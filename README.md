# Daily Log
Daily log is a simple desktop app, made in Java.

Main purpose of this app is personal usage, logging daily achievements and tracking important tasks.

Requirements for running the app:
- Online MySql server
- Java Runtime Environment  - JRE

# Disclaimer
Since this is my first desktop app, code can be kinda messy. Lot of mixed up concepts that I am not an expert in like design patterns.

# Implemented functionalities:
- Save login preset
- Adding new logs, tasks and removing them
- Automatic database modeling (not fully working, yet)

# Future todos:
- Add decent database manipulation options
